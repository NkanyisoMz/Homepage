# Homepage

### About the Project  
This is my solution to the **Homepage Assignment** from the **Advanced HTML and CSS** section of the Ruby on Rails path in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The project involved creating a fully responsive personal homepage showcasing my design skills and utilizing the concepts taught in the lessons.  

### Features  
- **Modern Design**: Inspired by the provided design mockups.  
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts seamlessly for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- **Icons**:  
  - GitHub, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter) icons sourced from [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/).  
  - Phone, email, and external link icons downloaded from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).  
- **Sections**:  
  - Header with a profile image and overlay text.  
  - An **About Me** section with my bio and social links.  
  - A **Projects** section showcasing my portfolio.  
  - A **Contact Me** section with my contact details and social media links.  

### Key Challenges  
1. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Ensuring all elements dynamically adjust for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
   - Addressing overflow, clipping, and proper spacing issues.  

2. **Grid Layouts**:  
   - Using CSS Grid for clean and structured layouts.  
   - Aligning content properly across sections like the **Projects** grid and **Contact Me** details.  

3. **Icon Integration**:  
   - Seamlessly integrating SVG icons for social links and contact information.  

### Lessons Learned  
- The importance of starting with a strong layout and refining it iteratively.  
- Using media queries to create a responsive design.  
- Managing and organizing CSS for readability and maintainability.  
- Leveraging `box-sizing`, `padding`, and `margin` for solving layout issues.  
- Dynamically centering elements for mobile using `margin: 0 auto` and `text-align`.  

### Tools and Technologies  
- **HTML5** and **CSS3**  
- **CSS Grid** for layout structure  
- **Google Fonts** for typography  
- Icons from [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
